bothers me that bidirectional dijkstra slower than normal.  change graph to entire USA and see if that holds.


still not fast enough
(havent checked to make sure it still works)

make contraction hierarchy building process faster
-limit hops speed up contraction hierarchy?





- speedwise would help a bit if edge hash distance lookup could be replaced by storing cost in adjacency list

Directed graph options

ArcFlags


after: golang

API Design

import {runContraction, Chase} from 'chase-js'
const {runContraction, runValidation, Chase} = require('chase-js');


 reference to my geojson cleanup library in Docs

 runContraction options: { (debug) }
 runValidation (looping segments or otherwise bad geojson)

 return Chase object

 new Chase()

 .saveHierarchy - this is just geojson w extra edges, + arc-flags + options metadata
 .loadHierarchy -
 .query({geojson=true, segmentIds=true, distance=true})
